Abstract

In this lab report, the application of quantum cryptography specifically the continuation of research done around internet security considering quantum cheques. The core of this proposal is built around the extension of research into a method written by Behera, Banerjee, & Panigrahi for the realisation of a quantum cheque on IBM’s quantum computer. Through this report one hopes to demonstrate the application of the Signature of the quantum cheque to the scheme of these algorithms. This report documents background research done at Salford University around quantum computing along with the key algorithms needed in order for this to come to an actuality. These consist of the generation algorithm (which initially generates the quantum cheque), the Sign algorithm (which will be investigated In this report; this signs the issuers amount, M), verification algorithm (which scrutinises the validity of a cheque) and the quantum teleportation algorithm (which will be needed to send information through the quantum internet and quantum systems). The simulator gave expectation values of  |000⟩ ≈ 25% ± 0.574%, |001⟩ ≈ 25% ± 0.530%, |010⟩ ≈ 25% ± 0. 287%, |011⟩ ≈ 25% ± 0.279%, where states |001⟩ and |011⟩ are considered a successful teleportation as the target qubit state has changed. These expectation values were moderately exceeded by the results from IBM’s quantum computer, with states of |000⟩ ≈ 19%  ± 0.417% , |001⟩ ≈ 32.8% ± 2.840%, |010⟩ ≈ 25.6% ± 1.356%, |011⟩ ≈ 22.7% ± 3.801% . The results from real quantum computer for the Sign Algorithm, were extremely close to the expectation values |00000⟩ ≈ 85.4%, |00100⟩ ≈ 14.6% ± 0.340% after application of the Sign Algorithm with state being |00000⟩ ≈ 81.2%, |00100⟩ ≈ 18.8% ± 1.562%
